1,escalate,"I had a friend that would go off about girls and get super depressed. He told me he was going to kill himself one night and I drove 1n hour and a half to go look for him. By then the cops had already taken him to the hospital but me and a friend went and hung out with him. Also been there to help try and talk him down. Another person I hadnt been friends with for years cause of some stuff called me out of the blue on thankgiving last year. I called back and got a hospital number so I knew something was up. Ended up being a kid who I was friends with years before but was a huge douche to me. He was in the psych ward for trying to kill himself. I got a hold of him and talked to him for a while. Whenever he would call I would answer and be there even though I still had the shit from years earlier on my mind. There are people that I might not want to be around but if it's a situation like this I'll be there for people. My goal or purpose in life that's sustained my survival is to help make other peoples lives a little bit better. Make people laugh when they're sad, help people out when nobody else will. Basically treat other humans even strangers with the respect and kindness of a friend. That's all people need sometime. Let people talk through their shit with me and offer helpful advice if I can. I'm still swimming in my own shit but that's enough to keep me going, keep that little light at the end of the tunnel switched on. Idk how long that will last but I'll be here till it flickers out.",,,,
2,escalate,"My friend dealt with anxiety and this desire for everything in her life to be perfect, she describes it as caring what happens to much, but either way I simply talked to her and when she would try and change the subject I would have to drag her back in due the fact that she didn't want to talk about it, but in reality she wouldn't get better unless i pulled her back into it and helped her through it. But how i helped was by basically talking to her, and giving her the advice she needed to hear, not the one she wanted to such as oh you'll be ok  this will all blow over"" what i said was more along the lines of being so blunt that many may find it rude but for her and i it was essential to making any progress.""""y friend dealt with anxiety and this desire for everything in her life to be perfect  she describes it as caring what happens to much  but either way I simply talked to her and when """,,,,
3,escalate,"Friend who had big addiction issues, ended up being completely isolated, skipped school, and had a very low self esteem. I convinced him to go see a doc together, and promised him that i would go through everything with him. He went to rehab for a few months and now he's clean. But the complete lack of support from his family, from school, changed him. I think it was too late when I helped him (he was like that for 5 months) and he'll never be the same as before.",,,,
4,do_not_escalate,"Over the internet a LOT of people write to me to talk about their problems. Its often girl related, I dont know, I guess it can be nice to rant to someone you dont know irl/someone who can look at the situation a little bit more objective? I think a lot of guys also feel that it can be hard to talk to girl friends irl about their innermost feelings sometimes, thats the feeling I get at least. My friend jokingly refers to me as an Agony Aunt""",,,,
5,escalate,"Having gone through depression and anxiety myself, I understand the struggles and have a few personal methods to cope when stuff hits.

I understand how important listening is and offer my experiences to help them get through what they face.",,,,
6,escalate,My now girlfriend used to have serious addiction troubles before we started dating and felt as though her addiction defined her as a person.

Now she asks me if it's ok he didn't say ""please"" when he said  ""hand me the remote.""",,,,

9,do_not_escalate,I've always been a good listener for people and I think a lot of people just want to be heard and not necessarily fixed.

10,escalate,"I feel completely alone, even with people around, but not in any ordinary sense.
